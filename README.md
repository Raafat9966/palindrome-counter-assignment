# Palindrome counter
The goal of this assignment is to write a palindrome counter that counts the palindromes found
in a given input file.

## Software requirements
- node.js, npm
- tested with node.js version 14.17.6 on Windows 10
- if you use a newer node.js version there might be a warning "old lockfile" - but it should work regardless

## How to run the program
- Run "npm i" once to install all the dependencies
- Then run it with "node app.js filename"
- Example: "node app.js input01.txt" runs it with the first input file

## Requirements
- Your part starts in the find-palindromes.js, which is called by the app.js
- The app.js must not be changed
- The functional requirements are in the find-palindromes.js as a comment at the top
- You can add additional npm packages, files, tests and scripts
- The input*.txt files contain different approval cases
- When in doubt, git commit early and often, and don't squash the commits at the end. 
  This gives you (and us) the chance to talk about how you approached the task in retrospective.

## Input files
- The number of counted palindromes in the input files is: 
  - input01.txt: 0
  - input02.txt: 1
  - input03.txt: 4
  - input04.txt: 5
  - input05.txt: 3
